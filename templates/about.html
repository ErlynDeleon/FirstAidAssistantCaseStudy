          <p class="card-text">
            The <strong>First Aid Assistant</strong> is a research-based expert
            system designed to suggest emergency actions based on incident
            descriptions such as choking, bleeding, and burns. It leverages a
            rule-based engine developed in Python to provide accurate, immediate
            advice to untrained individuals in critical moments.
          </p>

          <h5 class="card-title text-primary mt-4">Research and Development</h5>
          <p class="card-text">
            This system was developed as part of a project for the
            <strong>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, Information Systems</strong> at
            <strong>New Era University</strong>. The project was carried out by
            <strong>Richmond A. Baltazar</strong> and
            <strong>Erlyn Queen V. De Leon</strong>. The development aimed to explore the
            practical application of AI in public health and emergency
            preparedness.
